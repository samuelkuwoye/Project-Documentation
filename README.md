### Project Overview
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the pizza market, highlighting key trends, consumer preferences, production factors, and future outlooks. As one of the most popular and globally consumed fast foods, pizza continues to evolve in terms of ingredients, formats, and consumption behavior

The global pizza market has experienced steady growth over the past decade. Major drivers include increased urbanization, the rise of food delivery services, and the widespread appeal of customizable food options. North America remains the largest consumer region, followed by Europe and Asia-Pacific, where demand is rapidly rising.
